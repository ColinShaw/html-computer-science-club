### What Is Computer Science Club?

A group that gets together to discuss and present about computer science topics.  This
is a fairly wide swath of ideas, historically ranging from functional implementation
of a regular expression evaluator, comparing and contrasting FFTs in several language
styles (OO vs functional), gradient descent backpropagation in OCaml (you may note a bit
of a thing for function at this point), numerical optimizations for OCaml to avoid 
the heap issues for fast list multiplication (hmmm, that functional theme again), and
even things related to robotic and self-driving cars, like Kalman filters.

What makes it different from other groups is being language agnostic and more 
focused on how to solve problems abstractly.  There is generally also more rigor.  Not
the kind you would get in a detailed class about a topic, but the kind you would expect
from a one hour lecture having to do with getting someone to understand the wide
scope of the topic, often including history, theory and an implementation example. So 
no, this isn't a programming language group focused on implementing some particularly
sexy new whatever in some hot at the moment language. 



### What Should I Do Having Seen This Repo

Well, all graphic content is copyright Colin Shaw.  I don't mind if 
you use it for in-kind purposes, as I would like to see more local organizations attempting
to educate people about computer science and programming in general.  If you
do end up cloning the repo, using some of the content or ideas, drop me a 
line so I can link to your site!
